<br>using cookies 
Cookies can be used to improve user experience by storing bits of personal information from the user. The best example is Googles last opened tab when open a browser; it speeds up loading time and overall just improves user experience and what a program can do with a user without prompting them over and over. The biggest negative with cookies is that in the end it is personal information from the user that most of the time the user is not aware is getting taken from them. <br>
<br>Cookies are ethical depending how a person looks at it, because now websites are required to ask users to accept cookies before they use their website. However on the other hand, the terms and services of the uses of how cookies are not considered ethical in my opinion. Websites will flat out either wont work or barely work without cookies which forces users to accept the website to harvest their cookies for whatever purpose they want. Most times in the terms in services they are the same thing with a (few exceptions) the site is allowed to take your cookies for as long as youâ€™re on the website and they retain the right to use them for whatever the terms defines.
